        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Blood is a vital fluid in the human body, essential for transporting nutrients, oxygen, and waste, and plays a crucial role in the immune system and regulation of various bodily functions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="what-is-blood">
        <h2>What is Blood?</h2>
        <p>Blood is a specialized bodily fluid that delivers necessary substances to the body's cells and transports waste products away from those same cells.</p>
        <h3>Components</h3>
        <h4>Red Blood Cells (RBCs)</h4>
        <p>Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and returning carbon dioxide to the lungs for exhalation.</p>
        <h4>White Blood Cells (WBCs)</h4>
        <p>White blood cells are part of the immune system, helping to defend the body against infectious disease and foreign invaders. Types include lymphocytes and neutrophils.</p>
        <h4>Platelets</h4>
        <p>Platelets are involved in blood clotting, helping to prevent bleeding when injuries occur.</p>
        <h4>Plasma</h4>
        <p>Plasma is the liquid component of blood, composed mostly of water, proteins, and electrolytes, which serves as the medium for carrying cells and nutrients throughout the body.</p>

        <h2>Functions of Blood</h2>
        <h3>Transport</h3>
        <p>Blood transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body.</p>
        <h3>Protection</h3>
        <p>Blood plays a role in the immune response and clotting, protecting the body from infection and injury.</p>
        <h3>Regulation</h3>
        <p>Blood helps regulate body temperature, pH levels, and fluid balance.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="blood-types">
        <h2>Blood Types</h2>
        <h3>ABO Blood Group System</h3>
        <p>There are four main blood types: A, B, AB, and O, each determined by the presence or absence of certain antigens.</p>
        <h3>Rh Factor</h3>
        <p>The Rh factor is a protein that can be present on the surface of red blood cells. People with the protein are Rh positive, while those without it are Rh negative.</p>
        <h3>Compatibility</h3>
        <p>Blood type compatibility is crucial for safe blood transfusions. Certain blood types can donate to and receive from specific other types.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="blood-donation">
        <h2>Blood Donation</h2>
        <h3>Importance</h3>
        <p>Blood donation is crucial for saving lives, as donated blood is used in surgeries, cancer treatment, and managing chronic illnesses.</p>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>The blood donation process includes registration, health screening, donation, and post-donation refreshments and recovery.</p>
        <h3>Eligibility</h3>
        <p>Donors must meet certain criteria, including age, weight, and health status, to ensure the safety of both the donor and recipient.</p>
        <h3>Types of Donations</h3>
        <p>There are different types of blood donations, including whole blood, apheresis (platelets, plasma, red cells), and more.</p>

    <section id="blood-disorders">
        <h2>Blood Disorders and Diseases</h2>
        <h3>Anemia</h3>
        <p>Anemia is a condition where there is a lack of healthy red blood cells to carry sufficient oxygen to the body's tissues.</p>
        <h3>Hemophilia</h3>
        <p>Hemophilia is a rare disorder in which the blood doesn't clot normally due to lack of sufficient blood-clotting proteins.</p>
        <h3>Leukemia</h3>
        <p>Leukemia is a type of cancer found in your blood and bone marrow, caused by the rapid production of abnormal white blood cells.</p>
        <h3>Thalassemia</h3>
        <p>Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized by less hemoglobin and fewer red blood cells than normal.</p>
        <h3>Other Disorders</h3>
        <p>Other common blood disorders include clotting disorders, sickle cell disease, and more.</p>
